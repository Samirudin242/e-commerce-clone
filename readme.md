# E-Commerce

This E-commerce website using UI / UX inspired from [Tokopedia](https://tokopedia.com) and [Bukalapak](https://bukalapak.com). The backend technology uses [node.js](https://nodejs.org), [express.js](https://expressjs.com), [appolo server](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server/), and [mongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) as its databases. Frontend technology uses [react.js](https://reactjs.org), [appolo client](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/). This my personal project and the website itself is not 100% complete and is still in the process of adding some features üë®üèª‚Äçüíª .
